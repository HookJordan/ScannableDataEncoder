# ScannableDataEncoder
The ScannableDataEncoding is a tool used to create simple images that be printed and scanned back into a computer. In order to acheive this data must be converted to Binary values and then out putted as colors in which should be easily identifyable on paper. This is a long process and thus this project is for research and educational purposes and should not be used in a real world, mission critical application! 
<br /> <br />
The idea behind this project is to create an encoder that will created images based on encrypted data that can be store in real paper files and recovered back into the system when needed without having to manually type it out. E.G. you could save an encrypted source code in a set of paper files and load it back when needed. Burning paper is faster then formatting drives! <br />
